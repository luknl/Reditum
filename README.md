# Reditum

My first react-native app created in 10 days for a school project. It allows you to rediscover the story of monuments in your neighborhood, how time has transformed or erased them. In french.

Application based on the [NativeBase KichenSink template](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/NativeBase-KitchenSink), using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
